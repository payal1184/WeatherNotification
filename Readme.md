## üöÄ Project Setup & Configuration

Here‚Äôs a visual walkthrough of how this AWS Weather Notification project was built and configured.


## üß© Step 1: OpenWeatherMap API
Created an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch real-time weather data.
The API key allows the Lambda function to access current weather data.

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: AWS Lambda Function

Created a Lambda function to process weather data and send alerts.

displays the Lambda function code editor, where the Python script fetches live weather data using OpenWeatherMap API and publishes notifications through Amazon SNS.

## üîê Step 3: IAM Roles & Policies
  
The IAM role allows the Lambda function to securely publish messages to SNS.

Attached roles and policies to give Lambda the required permissions.   
These permissions enable the Lambda function to send notifications securely and reliably.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 4: Amazon SNS Topic

Created an SNS topic to send weather notifications.
Email subscription is confirmed to receive alerts.
Alerts are sent using the Email protocol.

## üìÖ Step 5: Amazon EventBridge Scheduler
Scheduled a rule to trigger the Lambda function at regular intervals.  

- **Service:** Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Event)  
- **Frequency:** Every 1 hour  
- **Target:** Lambda function

## üìñ Step 6: Amazon CloudWatch Logs
Monitored Lambda execution logs to ensure proper functioning and debug errors.  

- **Service:** Amazon CloudWatch Logs  
- **Purpose:** View function logs, track errors and notifications

## üíª Step 7: Testing & Notification
Tested the Lambda function to verify:  

1. Weather data fetched correctly  
2. Alerts sent via SNS to subscribed email
