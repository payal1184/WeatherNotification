## üöÄ Project Setup & Configuration

Here‚Äôs a visual walkthrough of how this AWS Weather Notification project was built and configured.


## üß© Step 1: OpenWeatherMap API
Created an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch real-time weather data.
The API key allows the Lambda function to access current weather data.

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: AWS Lambda Function

Created a Lambda function to process weather data and send alerts.

displays the Lambda function code editor, where the Python script fetches live weather data using OpenWeatherMap API and publishes notifications through Amazon SNS.

## üîê Step 3: IAM Roles & Policies
  
The IAM role allows the Lambda function to securely publish messages to SNS.

Attached roles and policies to give Lambda the required permissions.   
These permissions enable the Lambda function to send notifications securely and reliably.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 4: Amazon SNS Topic

Created an SNS topic to send weather notifications.
This topic acts as a communication channel for notifications.

Email subscription is confirmed to receive weather alerts.
Ensures that all notifications are successfully delivered to the user.

## üìÖ Step 5: Amazon EventBridge Scheduler
Scheduled a rule to trigger the Lambda function at regular intervals.  
Configured an EventBridge Scheduler to trigger the Lambda function at regular intervals.
This ensures that the weather data is fetched and alerts are sent automatically without manual execution.
The schedule runs the function reliably at the defined time interval.

## üìñ Step 6: Amazon CloudWatch Logs

Integrated Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor and verify Lambda function executions.
Created a dedicated CloudWatch Log Group to store Lambda execution logs.

Log streams capture detailed information about API responses, notifications, and errors.

Displays detailed log events from each Lambda execution, including API responses and SNS confirmations.  
Useful for debugging issues and verifying successful alert delivery.

## üíª Step 7: Testing & Notification

Tested the Lambda function to verify:  

1. Weather data fetched successfully  
2. Alerts sent via SNS to subscribed email
