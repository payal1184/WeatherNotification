## üöÄ Project Setup & Configuration

Here‚Äôs a visual walkthrough of how this AWS Weather Notification project was built and configured.


## üß© Step 1: OpenWeatherMap API
Created an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch real-time weather data.  

- **Service:** OpenWeatherMap  
- **Purpose:** Fetch current weather data via API

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 3: Amazon SNS Topic
Configured an SNS topic to send notifications to subscribers. 

Alerts from the Lambda function are published to this SNS topic.  
Subscribers receive notifications via email whenever a message is sent.  
SNS ensures reliable and timely delivery of messages.

## üìÖ Step 4: Amazon EventBridge Scheduler
Scheduled a rule to trigger the Lambda function at regular intervals.  

- **Service:** Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Event)  
- **Frequency:** Every 1 hour  
- **Target:** Lambda function

## üìñ Step 5: Amazon CloudWatch Logs
Monitored Lambda execution logs to ensure proper functioning and debug errors.  

- **Service:** Amazon CloudWatch Logs  
- **Purpose:** View function logs, track errors and notifications

## üîê Step 6: IAM Roles & Policies
Attached IAM roles and policies to Lambda for SNS publish permissions.  

- **Service:** AWS IAM  
- **Purpose:** Secure access management for Lambda function

## üíª Step 7: Testing & Notification
Tested the Lambda function to verify:  

1. Weather data fetched correctly  
2. Alerts sent via SNS to subscribed email
